# This repo is a fork of the suckless-utils
- It contains my version of configured keybinds, themes, etc and ready to use suckless utils.
- I have made this repo to keep track of my changes as well as added the main repo of dwm, st and surf from https://git.savannah.org/dwm-or-st-or-surf as a submodule to add updates to my own configuration from their repos and keep the suckless utils up to date and avoid any breakages
- That's all If you want to clone this repo be sure to keep track of the changes in the main repo as well.
